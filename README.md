A collection of interesting algorithms and code samples.

AutocompleteTrie
In Swift and Java. A trie data sctructure that incrementally calculates the Damerau-Levenstein distance between a stream of input characters and words saved in the trie. After each letter is entered into the AutocompleteTrie, it returns all of the words that could both complete and be within a maximum distance threshold of what has been entered so far.
